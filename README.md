## Product Service UI
This is a simple App that fetches a list of Products from the Product Service(backend) and
displays these values in a table if the user enters a money mount (in â‚¬) which is
greater than the price of the product. The app then calculates how many kilograms the user
can buy the money amount. If the backend service is not available, a simple alert should 
be displayed on the screen. 

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
The Product Service UI app currently runs on [http://localhost:3000/products](http://localhost:3000/products).
